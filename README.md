# EscapeFromKitchen-VR-game-

Escape From the Kitchen is a Virtual Reality game done at school with three other students with Unity. It is compatible with Pico Xr Headsets, using XR_SDK.

The main goal is to help chickens reach a portal (the yellow one) from another portal (the blue one). When playing, you have in front of you a game board similar to a little kitchen with many objects on it, disposed on a grid. On the right, you can find a table with a lever and two buttons above it. The lever allow the player to rotate the game board, useful if an object is not directly accessible from its position. The red button, when pressed, switches off the induction hobs. The pink one resets the level. The chickens just go straight forward by default, and go back when hitting a wall. Seeds allow them to change path and spatula help them jump. Boiling oil and induction hogs are traps that kill chickens at contact, but a breadboard can cover the oil and hogs can be switched off. We can interact with any item using the hand controler.

For more information on the creation process, please read the report, or take a look at the presentation if you need more visual assets to understand the game. These files are currently in french, but an english version may arrive soon.
